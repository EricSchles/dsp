[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>>

**Problem** : Quantifying the difference between total weight in pounds and pregnancy length using Cohen's d between first babies and other babies.

**How I solved it** : I imported the data from nsfg and the Cohen's *d* function from thinkstats2. I then quantified the difference between the total weight in lbs. From there, I calculated the pregancy length and also applied the Cohen's *d* calculation to quantify the difference between pregnancy lengths.

**Solution**:

```python
import nsfg
import thinkstats2 as
```
