[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>>

**Problem** : The question being asked revolves around whether or not numbers generated by random.random followed the uniform distribution (meaning that every value has the same probability).

**How I solved it** : For this problem, I plotted both the PMF and CDF to determine whether or not the numbers generated by random.random were uniform. By plotting thew CDF, this would help with the larger sample of values being returned and help reduce effects of random "noise". It would also be a lot easier to identify whether or not random.random was truly distributed uniformly.

**Solution** :

```python

import random
import thinkstats2

%matplotlib inline

#plotting PMF
random_values = [random.random() for x in range(1001)]
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_values)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Value', ylabel='Probability')

#Plotting CDF
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_values)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Percentile Rank', ylabel='CDF')

```

**Discussion** : As one can see, both the PMF and CDF display the same results, which is that the random value generator is uniformly distributed. However, the PMF graph is extremely busy and much more difficult to interpret. Taking a look at the CDF graph, one can see that a straight line (which indicates that the the percentile rank is proportional to its CDF) is a lot easier to view.
